        <p>Ok, so we can’t really guarantee you won’t kill your houseplants. <br></br>Plants have different needs and react to sunlight, water, and fertilizer in a variety of ways. Learn about their needs and you might be able to stop the damage in time. Use a little extra TLC, and they might even <i>flourish</i>.</p>

        <p>Not sure where to start? <br></br>Our app is here to help you figure out what your plants need and how you can nurture them.</p>

        <h2>Identify Your Plant</h2>
        <p>Manually enter your plant babies' species into the app and you'll get a brief description of what your plants should look like when they're healthy, care instructions with their water and light preferences, as well as a list of common issues that cause them to fall ill.</p>

        <h2>Smart Tracking</h2>
        <p>By logging the different species of plants you have at home, you can manually keep track of the light intensity of the room in which they're placed and <b>get push notifications</b> about when you should water them based on the weather in your area.</p>
